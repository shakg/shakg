# Ishak Gönül

Senior Software Engineer building **Ground Control Systems**, **UAV tooling**, and **real-time telemetry/navigation** systems.

- I like systems that are *fast, observable, and boringly reliable*.
- My comfort zone: **Client Apps(Tauri, electron, QT ...)**, realtime pipelines, geospatial math, and GPU-friendly visualization.


## What I’m working on

- **Mission-critical GPS tracking**: secure auth + encrypted transport + RBAC, and sub-second updates at scale.
- **Navigation & trajectory**: interpolation (splines), sensor fusion, predictive pathing for degraded GPS.
- **Geospatial systems**: geofencing, polygon-based detection, terrain/geometry, and map-centric visualization.

## Featured projects

- **desketch** — Local-first desktop drawing app (Tauri + tldraw)  
  Repo: https://github.com/shakg/desketch

- **g-systemctl** — TUI for managing system services (Linux/macOS): search/filter/control daemons from terminal  
  Repo: https://github.com/shakg/g-systemctl

- **qgcd** — Pure C++ MAVLink daemon: telemetry/control over ZeroMQ (backend for separated GCS architecture)  
  Repo: https://github.com/shakg/qgcd

- **zmq-client** — ZeroMQ client utilities / experiments  
  Repo: https://github.com/shakg/zmq-client

## Toolbox

**Languages:** TypeScript, Go, C#, C++  
**Frontend:** Angular, React, CesiumJS, WebGL  
**Transports:** MAVLink, UDP/TCP, Serial, DDS, ROS, protobuffers
**DevOps/Automation:** Docker, GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Yocto  
**Testing:** Jest, Mocha, Jasmine, Playwright, GTEST

## About me

Avionics background. I’ve spent the last ~5+ years shipping software for UAV/GCS and real-time tracking systems—algorithms, rendering, and backend pipelines.
